# Hello, I'm Renata Oliveira (She/Her)

I'm an IT professional with over 5 years of experience with startups. Most of my work experience is in UX/UI and QA 
Tester, but I'm constantly dipping my toes into new waters. I have already worked in positions ranging from Support, QA 
Tester, UX/UI, and Scrum Master in my career. As a result, I have worked with most software development 
lifecycles and feel comfortable designing to achieve efficiency and good experiences.

📚 Currently, I'm working on enhancing my programming abilities, with a particular emphasis on automated testing using 
Cypress and Selenium. However, I have already automated tests with Python and run them in GitHub Actions to learn more about both.
