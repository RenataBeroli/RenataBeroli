# Hello, I'm Renata Oliveira

I'm an generalist IT professional, most of my work experience is as UX or Scrumm master, but I'm always dipping my toes into new waters. 

Currently I'm trying to improve my skill in programming focusing first at backend development with Django.


## 2022 goals 

- [x] Develop a small django application.
- [ ] Develop a small game API with django rest framework.
- [ ] Play with github actions and automated tests.
- [ ] Learn a bit of react.
- [ ] Develop a mobile App.
