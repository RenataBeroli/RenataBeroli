# Hello, I'm Renata Oliveira (She/Her)

I'm an IT professional with over five years of experience with startups, most of my work experience is as UX/UI and Scrum 
master, but I'm constantly dipping my toes into new waters. I have already worked in positions ranging from Support, QA 
Tester, UX/UI, and Scrum Master in my career. As a result, I can say that I worked with most of the software development 
lifecycle and feel comfortable designing to achieve efficiency and good experiences.

Currently, I'm trying to improve my programming skills, focusing first on backend development with Django and using 
Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to finish the interfaces. However, I have already done some automatized testings with Python 
and run them in GitHub Actions to learn more about both.
